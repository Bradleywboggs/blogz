# The Lost Bee 
a **Bee** in this application refers to something akin to the old practice
of  'Quilting Bees' when people from the community would
gather to work on quilt together.

In this application, we're translating
this idea into a similar concept where a digital community
can gather and work on their own individual crafty projects,
but they can do so together, sharing ideas, tips, resources, etc.
The site will have as its crux the 'BEE' space,
consisting of:
 - a page to view and join open bees 
 - view past bees
 - and start a new bee.
 - The site will also have a standard Blog space for the Website's curator,
and possibly other users as the curator gives permissions.
- Finally, the site will have an online store for the website curator's wares
served likely by a third party for security reasons.
